# Ada Palindrome

Test and debug this palindrome project; to run the code you need to invoke/call/execute the palindrome arrow function
Unfortunately, the developer did not adopt any clear standards in their code and now its your job to reformat, test and debug the project

Suggested Task Order:
1. Run the code to see the current state
2. Make a copy of the current code base; perhaps just duplicate the index page.
3. Restructure the code so that it follows clear and readable standards
4. Run the code to see if there are any new errors
5. Debug the code so it confirms when a word is a palindrome; syntax and symantic problems may exist
6. If not already done, adopt a better naming convention
7. Improve the user's experience by helping them understand what they need to do
8. Refactor the code so the project ignores case (for example Rotor is a palindrome).
9. Compare your experience with your peers â€“ what was easy, challenging etc, what the main issues was, how should the program have been designed, commented, etc?
